# My-first-software-development-repository
This software repository contains my first software for the module Software Development. It stores all of the related files including a README file which contains information about the software I have written.

My name is Dr Paul Sant and I am an academic and software developer. I am using GitHub to share my projects collabortively with the rest of the world.
